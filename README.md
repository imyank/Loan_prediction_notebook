## Problem Statement

Predict Loan Eligibility for Dream Housing Finance company
Dream Housing Finance company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customers segments that are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. 



## Overview

In this project I have used various ML algorithms to predict loan status of for a given person.
It is a binary classification project.
Nan values are handled using median or mode and other imputation.
Some new attributes are created like debt ratio, EMI etc.
Various algorithms used like XGboost classifier tuned with GridSearchCV, logistic regression,
Tpot classifier etc.

## XGBoost with proper tuning gives the best results on submission around 81%
